Creation Operation in Three.js

1. ☑ design stroke drawing canva
2. ☑ resample the input stroke and form external edges
3. ☑ perform constrained Delaunay triangulation of the polygon+
4. ☑ obtained the chordal axis
5. ☑ prune insignificant branches and obtain the pruned spine
6. ☐ make the resulting polygons triangulated
7. ☐ elevate the verteces of the spine and convert other internal edges to a quarter oval
8. ☐ sew together the neighboring elevated edges
9. ☐ copy the resulting mesh to the other side and get the final mesh
