Creation Operation in Three.js

1. ☑ design stroke drawing canva
2. ☑ resample the input stroke and form external edges
3. ☐ perform constrained Delaunay triangulation of the polygon
    * ☐ what's constrained Delaunay triangulation
    * ☐ an algorithm for performing constrained Delaunay triangulation
    * ☐ how to represent a triangle in Three.js (somthing that might need to take into account: its adjacent triangles, the type of the triangle)
4. ☐ obtained the chordal axis
5. ☐ prune insignificant branches and obtain the pruned spine
    * is it necessary?
6. ☐ make the resulting polygons triangulated
7. ☐ elevate the verteces of the spine and convert other internal edges to a quarter oval
8. ☐ sew together the neighboring elevated edges
9. ☐ copy the resulting mesh to the other side and get the final mesh
