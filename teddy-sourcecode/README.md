1.How to start the program?

There are two ways to play with Teddy.

One is to start Teddy as a JAVA applet in your browser.
Open "teddy.html" in Internet Explorer
and the applet version of Teddy starts.
The applet version has sounds, but you cannot save the models you create.
(if this does not work, you need to install java plugin from www.java.com).

The other is to run Teddy as an independent JAVA program.
It has no sounds, but you can save the model (.obj file format) you create.
Open "teddy.bat" and the program starts 
(this may not work for Windows XP or later. In that case,
please install java from www.java.com and then open "teddy.jar").


2. Cautions

This program is developed as a research prototype and 
is not designed for real-use.
It contains many bugs. 
If the system's behavior looks strange, press "Undo" immediately. 
If the system still works strangely,
please "reload" the applet, or quit and restart the program.
